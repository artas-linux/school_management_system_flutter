# School Management System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
The system must prioritize intuitive user experience for Students, Teachers, and Parents. All features and workflows should be designed with the end user in mind, ensuring accessibility and ease of use across all platforms (Android, iOS, Web). The UI/UX must be responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes and user capabilities.

### II. Role-Based Access Control (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All system components must implement strict role-based access control. Students, Teachers, and Parents must only access data and features relevant to their roles. This principle is non-negotiable and all implementations must be verified to ensure no unauthorized access to sensitive information.

### III. Cross-Platform Consistency
The Flutter-based application must provide consistent functionality and user experience across all supported platforms (Android, iOS, Web). Data synchronization must be seamless and all features must be available on all platforms, with appropriate adaptations for platform-specific conventions.

### IV. Data Privacy & Security
All student and parent data must be handled according to educational data protection compliance standards. End-to-end encryption for sensitive data transmission and secure storage practices are mandatory. Any feature handling personal information must undergo security review before implementation.

### V. Spec-Driven Development with Qwen CLI
All features must follow the specification-driven development approach. Each feature must be clearly specified with user stories, acceptance criteria, and test scenarios before implementation. The Qwen CLI and Speckit framework must be used for task management and feature development to ensure consistency and traceability.

## Additional Constraints & Requirements

### Performance Standards
All features must meet defined performance benchmarks:
- Dashboard load time < 3 seconds on standard mobile network
- Data synchronization with offline cache < 5 seconds
- Search operations response time < 1 second for up to 10,000 records
- Support for concurrent users during peak hours (typically 8-10 AM and 2-4 PM)

### Offline-First Architecture
The system must support critical functionality when offline. Essential data (schedules, grades, notifications) must be available offline with synchronization when connectivity is restored. Features must gracefully handle network interruptions.

### Scalability Requirements
The system architecture must support:
- Up to 10,000 students per instance
- Concurrent access by 1,000+ users during peak times
- Efficient data management and retrieval as data volume grows

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

### Feature Development Process
1. All features must begin with a clear specification using the Speckit framework
2. User stories must clearly define benefits for Students, Teachers, or Parents
3. Code implementation must follow Flutter best practices and architectural patterns
4. Automated testing must cover 80%+ of code with feature-specific test scenarios
5. All changes must pass review by team members before merging

### Quality Gates
- All PRs must pass automated tests (unit, integration, contract)
- Performance metrics must meet defined standards
- Security checks must pass for any new data handling features
- UI/UX consistency review by designated team member
- Cross-platform functionality verification

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and must be referenced in all technical decisions. Amendments require documentation, team approval, and migration plan for existing features. All PRs and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with clear user benefit, following "start simple, expand thoughtfully" principles.
