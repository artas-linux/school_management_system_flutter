## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-16
- Q: What exactly should the system integrate with? → A: Create a framework/api layer to interface with existing Zen tools
- Q: What specific capabilities must be available for team adoption? → A: Basic framework with thinkdeep and debug tools integration
- Q: What metrics will measure precision and debugging time improvements? → A: Track code review findings and issue resolution time; Use code quality scoring tools and developer surveys
- Q: How should developers access the integrated Zen tools? → A: CLI commands integrated into existing development workflows
- Q: What security measures for accessing AI tools? → A: All processing happens locally within the development environment

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enhanced AI Tool Integration (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on the school management system, I want to leverage advanced AI tools like thinkdeep, debug, and other Zen tools to improve the precision of code analysis, debugging, and development decisions.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for improving development quality and reducing time to market by leveraging AI capabilities to catch issues early and provide better architectural guidance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring the number of issues identified by Zen tools compared to traditional methods and the improvement in code quality metrics using code review findings and issue resolution time tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a development task requiring architecture decisions, **When** the developer uses thinkdeep via CLI, **Then** they receive comprehensive analysis with multiple approaches and trade-offs considered
2. **Given** a bug in the codebase, **When** the developer uses the debug Zen tool via CLI, **Then** they receive systematic analysis that identifies the root cause efficiently

### User Story 2 - Improved Debugging Capabilities (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to use enhanced debugging tools integrated with MCP (Model Context Protocol) to more effectively troubleshoot complex issues in the Flutter application.

**Why this priority**: Enhanced debugging capabilities will reduce time spent on troubleshooting and improve overall development velocity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring the time taken to identify and fix bugs with the enhanced tools versus traditional debugging methods using issue resolution time tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a complex Flutter application issue, **When** the developer uses the enhanced debugging tools via CLI, **Then** they receive detailed analysis of the problem and potential solutions

---

### User Story 3 - MCP Server Integration (Priority: P3)

As a development team, we want to potentially add additional MCP servers (like Chrome DevTools integration) to enhance our development workflow and debugging capabilities.

**Why this priority**: This provides future extensibility and allows for deeper integration with development tools that our team uses regularly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting up an example MCP server integration and verifying it enhances the development workflow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the need for advanced debugging, **When** Chrome DevTools or similar MCP server is integrated with CLI access, **Then** developers can access enhanced debugging capabilities directly through their tools

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support integration with thinkdeep and similar Zen tools for enhanced analysis via a framework/api layer
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide structured integration with debugging tools that follow MCP protocols
- **FR-003**: Development team MUST be able to leverage debug, thinkdeep and other Zen tools in their development workflow via CLI commands
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing Flutter development tools and workflows
- **FR-005**: Integration MUST follow specification-driven development principles as defined in the project constitution
- **FR-006**: Framework MUST be implemented with basic thinkdeep and debug tools integration initially for team adoption
- **FR-007**: All AI tool processing MUST happen locally within the development environment to ensure data security

### Key Entities

- **Zen Tools Integration**: The framework that allows using thinkdeep, debug, and other Zen tools within the development workflow
- **MCP Protocol**: The Model Context Protocol that enables communication between tools and development environment
- **Local Processing**: Security measure ensuring all sensitive code/data remains within the development environment

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can use thinkdeep and other Zen tools to analyze code with 30% more precision than without these tools, measured by code quality scoring tools and developer surveys
- **SC-002**: Debugging time for complex issues is reduced by 25% when using enhanced tools, measured by issue resolution time tracking
- **SC-003**: Development team adoption rate of Zen tools is 80% within 2 weeks of implementation
- **SC-004**: Code quality metrics (bugs per deployment, time to fix issues) improve by 20% after tool integration, measured by code review findings
