# Research: Improving Precision with Zen and MCP Tools

## Decision: CLI Integration Approach for Zen Tools
**Rationale**: A CLI wrapper approach provides the simplest integration with existing development workflow while maintaining local processing for security. This approach works well with the existing mise task management system in the project.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Direct IDE plugin integration (more complex, IDE-specific)
- Web dashboard (requires network connectivity, security concerns)
- In-code integration (tight coupling with application code)

## Decision: Local-Only Processing Architecture
**Rationale**: Processing stays local to ensure data security and privacy as required by project constitution. This also allows for offline usage and reduces external dependencies.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Hybrid cloud/local processing (more complex, potential security risks)
- Pure cloud processing (violates security requirements)

## Decision: Wrapper Scripts for Tool Integration
**Rationale**: Wrapper scripts provide a simple abstraction layer between the development workflow and the various Zen tools, making it easy to add new tools in the future.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct API integration (tight coupling, harder to maintain)
- Plugin system (more complex initial implementation)

## Decision: Metrics Tracking via Existing Tooling
**Rationale**: Using existing Flutter/Dart testing and analysis tools to measure improvements, with custom scripts for specific metrics like issue resolution time.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom metrics dashboard (over-engineering for initial implementation)
- Third-party analytics tools (privacy concerns)
