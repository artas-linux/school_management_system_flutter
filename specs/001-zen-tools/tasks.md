# Tasks: Improving Precision with Zen and MCP Tools

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-zen-tools/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The example includes test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `lib/`, `test/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create scripts/zen-tools directory structure for tool integration
- [X] T002 [P] Add zen-tools dependencies to pubspec.yaml
- [X] T003 [P] Create lib/core/zen_integration.dart file stub
- [X] T004 Set up testing infrastructure in test/unit/ and test/integration/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Implement basic ZenToolsFramework class with id, version, configuration, and status attributes in lib/core/zen_integration.dart
- [X] T006 [P] Create base security configuration with localOnly flag and dataHandlingPolicy in lib/core/zen_integration.dart
- [X] T007 [P] Set up wrapper script framework in scripts/zen-tools/cli_interface.sh
- [X] T008 Create configuration file structure for tool integration
- [X] T009 Implement basic CLI command handler structure for routing commands to tools

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Enhanced AI Tool Integration (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable developers to leverage thinkdeep and debug tools via CLI, improving code analysis precision and development decisions

**Independent Test**: Tool can be invoked via CLI and returns comprehensive analysis with multiple approaches and trade-offs considered

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Create thinkdeep wrapper script in scripts/zen-tools/thinkdeep_wrapper.sh
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Create debug wrapper script in scripts/zen-tools/debug_wrapper.sh  
- [X] T012 [US1] Implement ZenTool interface class with toolName, toolType, cliCommand, supportedFeatures, and isActive in lib/core/zen_integration.dart
- [X] T013 [US1] Add thinkdeep and debug tools to the tool registry
- [X] T014 [US1] Create CLI command handlers for 'mise run zen-thinkdeep' and 'mise run zen-debug' in .mise.toml
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement security configuration with local processing enforcement
- [ ] T016 [US1] Verify all processing happens locally without external network calls

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Improved Debugging Capabilities (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable developers to use enhanced debugging tools integrated with MCP protocol to troubleshoot Flutter application issues more effectively

**Independent Test**: Enhanced debugging tools can be used via CLI and return detailed analysis of problems and potential solutions

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T017 [P] [US2] Enhance debug wrapper script with MCP protocol integration in scripts/zen-tools/debug_wrapper.sh
- [ ] T018 [US2] Add MCP protocol handling capabilities to ZenTool interface
- [ ] T019 [US2] Create MCP protocol configuration and validation
- [ ] T020 [US2] Implement detailed analysis features for debug tool
- [ ] T021 [US2] Add metrics tracking for debugging time improvements
- [ ] T022 [US2] Test MCP integration with Flutter application debugging scenarios

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 should be independently testable with detailed analysis capabilities

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - MCP Server Integration (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable development team to add additional MCP servers like Chrome DevTools for enhanced development workflow

**Independent Test**: Additional MCP server can be integrated and provides enhanced debugging capabilities through CLI access

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T023 [P] [US3] Create generic MCP server integration framework in lib/core/zen_integration.dart
- [ ] T024 [US3] Implement Chrome DevTools MCP server connector
- [ ] T025 [US3] Add CLI command handler for Chrome DevTools integration
- [ ] T026 [US3] Create configuration template for adding new MCP servers
- [ ] T027 [US3] Verify new MCP server integration works with existing tool framework
- [ ] T028 [US3] Document process for adding future MCP servers

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 should be independently testable with Chrome DevTools integration

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final integration, metrics, and quality improvements

- [ ] T029 Add metrics tracking for code analysis precision improvements
- [ ] T030 Create metrics dashboard for issue resolution time tracking
- [ ] T031 Implement adoption rate tracking for development team usage
- [ ] T032 Add documentation for using the zen-tools integration
- [ ] T033 Update quickstart guide with new tool usage examples
- [ ] T034 Run comprehensive tests to verify all features meet success criteria
- [ ] T035 Performance testing to ensure commands execute within 10 seconds

---

## Dependencies

- User Story 2 [US2] depends on foundational security configuration (T006) and CLI command handler (T009)
- User Story 3 [US3] depends on foundational framework (T005, T009)

## Parallel Execution Examples

- T010, T011 [US1] can run in parallel as they modify different files
- T017 [US2] and T023 [US3] can run in parallel as they target different functionality
- T002, T003 in Phase 1 can run in parallel as they target different components

## Implementation Strategy

- MVP scope: Complete User Story 1 (T001-T016) to provide basic thinkdeep and debug tool integration
- Incremental delivery: Each user story phase provides independently valuable functionality
- Quality focus: Each phase includes its own security and local-processing verification
