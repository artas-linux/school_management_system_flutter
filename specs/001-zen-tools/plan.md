# Implementation Plan: Improving Precision with Zen and MCP Tools

**Branch**: `001-zen-tools` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 | **Spec**: [specs/001-zen-tools/spec.md](specs/001-zen-tools/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-zen-tools/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a framework/api layer to interface with existing Zen tools like thinkdeep and debug, providing CLI access to enhanced analysis and debugging capabilities for the Flutter-based school management system. This will improve precision in code analysis, debugging, and development decisions while ensuring all processing happens locally within the development environment for security.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Dart/Flutter (3.35.5), with additional tooling in Bash for CLI integration  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flutter SDK, Dart SDK, Qwen CLI, Speckit framework, MCP protocol implementation  
**Storage**: Local file system for configuration and cache (no persistent storage needed for the tools themselves)  
**Testing**: Dart/flutter tests, with integration tests for CLI commands and tool interactions  
**Target Platform**: Development environment (Linux, macOS, Windows) for developers working on the Flutter app  
**Project Type**: CLI tool integration and framework for development tools  
**Performance Goals**: Tool commands should execute within 10 seconds, with 95% of commands completing without errors  
**Constraints**: All processing must occur locally to ensure data security, integration must work with existing mise task management system  
**Scale/Scope**: Supports team of up to 10 developers using the enhanced tooling

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

This feature aligns with the project constitution:
- Follows spec-driven development with Qwen CLI (Principle V) ✓
- Maintains compatibility with existing Flutter development workflow ✓
- Implements security through local processing (Principle IV) ✓
- The CLI integration approach supports developer workflow (Principle I) ✓

No constitution violations identified.

**Structure Decision**: Single project approach with CLI integration scripts in a dedicated directory. The tool integrations are implemented as wrapper scripts that interface with the existing development workflow via the .mise.toml configuration.

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 0: Research & Architecture
- Completed research on CLI integration approaches for Zen tools
- Decided on local-only processing architecture for security
- Chose wrapper scripts approach for tool integration
- Determined metrics tracking via existing tooling approach

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Created data model for Zen tools integration framework
- Designed CLI command handlers for tool access
- Established security configuration for local processing
- Created quickstart guide for developers
- Updated agent context with new technology information
- Generated API contracts for tool interfaces

**Implementation Path**: 
1. Create wrapper scripts for thinkdeep and debug tools
2. Integrate with mise task management system
3. Implement security configuration for local-only processing
4. Add metrics tracking capabilities
5. Test integration with existing Flutter project workflows
